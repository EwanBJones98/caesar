This directory contains the uncompiled CAESAR documentation.  In order
to build the docs locally you will need the Sphinx python extension:

http://www.sphinx-doc.org/

This can typically be installed via `pip` **or** `conda`:

    $> pip install sphinx
    $> conda install sphinx

Once that is present you should be able to issue the following command
to build the documentation:

    $> make html

However, an always up-to-date version of the docs should be available
at:

http://caesar.readthedocs.org
